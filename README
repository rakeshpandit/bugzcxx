Bugzilla C/C++ XML-RPC Proxy
============================

This is a library intended as an interface proxy with the popular
Bugzilla bug tracking system to be used on C/C++ programs, this should
allow you create bug reports from your programs or even (as the
Bugzilla API matures) create your own bugzilla client programs.

Please file your bug reports directly to Sourceforge.net bug tracker,
or report bugs to developers mailing list. Please check already filled
bugs before reporting one.
