This software makes use of the GNU build tools, autoconf, automake,
libtool, etc. So you should be familiar with the configure, make, make
install process, if its the case fell free to follow your way, however
if you are new to this, look below.

For installing in your system:

Tune build environment
$ ./configure --help

Configure build
$ ./configure --disable-cxx

[whatever flags you want to put from the --help]
(If you want to build the doxygen documentation then add --enable-docs
 to configure, to enable support for UNSTABLE methods use
 --enable-unstable, in case you are using fresh check out from svn
 repo you will need to generate configure script using autogen.sh
 present in source tree script or autotools)

Build initial source code using:
$ make

Before installing and if you compiled the example programs (default)
then you're set to running most of them (if not all), just go to the
examples subdirectory, from there select which api you want to test
bugzc or bugzcxx inside you'll lots of suitable example programs.

Install library using:
$ make install

Tune build environment
./configure --help
