* Code has been written to support the UNSTABLE Bugzilla::WebService::Product
namespace with all its methods as seen in Bugzilla 3.0 online API docs.
* A few test programs have been changed so they now use non-deprecated functions
only (mostly methods that were using ugly dynamic arrays).
* Some pending date/time conversions have been finally implemented

* Added some general-purpose linked list functions and data structures,
hopefully some ugly string collection implementations will get cleaned as they
should have been in the first place, look for bugzc_list.h and bugzc_list.cpp
* Some progress has been made in order to support unstable methods from the
Bugzilla API, however specifically for Bug.get_bugs and Product.get_products
a few return values could not be implemented since they are not documented by
the Bugzilla guys at all.
* Got to deprecate to other functions bugzc_init and
bugzc_bug_legal_values, they have been superseeded by bugzc_init2 and
bugzc_bug_legal_values_list respectively.
* Some work has been started in order to support the unstable interface
Bugzilla::WebService::Product namespace, some test programs are still required
though.

* Some test programs were made to test user creation and account offering via
e-mail, nice code, seems to work fine.
* All namespaces are feature complete now with stable and experimental
functions only, no unstable functions coded yet which means that the 
Bugzilla::WebService::Product has been left behind in this release.
