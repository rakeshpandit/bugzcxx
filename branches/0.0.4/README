Bugzilla C/C++ XML-RPC Proxy.

This is a library intended as an interface proxy with the popular Bugzilla bug
tracking system to be used on C/C++ programs, this should allow you create bug
reports from your programs or even (as the Bugzilla API matures) create your
own bugzilla client programs.

At the beginning the main purpose for this library was to provide an interface
for automated bug reports in programs I develop at work, actually all I needed
was the Bugzilla::WebService::Bug::create method and the login/logout 
functions, but hey? why not have a little fun and code the rest?

Please file your bug reports directly to Sourceforge.net bug tracker, for now
its quite hard to get a proper Bugzilla hosting so you can report there, I'll
let you know when I have one ready though.
