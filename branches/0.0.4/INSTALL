This software makes use of the GNU build tools, autoconf, automake, 
libtool, etc. So you should be familiar with the configure, make,
make install process, if its the case fell free to follow your way,
however if you are new to this, look below.

Tune build environment
./configure --help

Configure build
./configure --disable-cxx [whatever flags you want to put from the --help]
(If you want to build the doxygen documentation then add --enable-docs to
 configure, to enable support for UNSTABLE methods use --enable-unstable)

Build initial source code
make

Before installing and if you compiled the example programs (default) then
you're set to running most of them (if not all), just go to the examples
subdirectory, from there select which api you want to test bugzc or bugzcxx
inside you'll lots of suitable example programs.

Install library
make install

Last step
Have fun!!!
